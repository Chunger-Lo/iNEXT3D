In this document, we provide a quick introduction demonstrating how to run `iNEXT3D`(iNterpolation and EXTrapolation for 3 Diversity class). 

`iNEXT3D` focuses on three measures of Hill numbers of order q: species richness (`q = 0`), Shannon diversity (`q = 1`, the exponential of Shannon entropy) and Simpson diversity 
(`q = 2`, the inverse of Simpson concentration) among three classes: taxonomic diversity ('TD'), phylogenetic diversity ('PD'), functional diversity ('FD'). For each diversity measure, `iNEXT3D` uses the observed sample of abundance or incidence data (called the “reference sample”) 
to compute diversity estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals for the following two types of rarefaction and extrapolation (R/E): 

1. Sample‐size‐based R/E sampling curves: `iNEX3T` computes diversity estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples up to an appropriate size. This type of sampling curve plots the diversity estimates with respect to sample size.     
2. Coverage‐based R/E sampling curves: `iNEXT3D` computes diversity estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples with sample completeness (as measured by sample coverage) up to an appropriate coverage. This type of sampling curve plots the diversity estimates with respect to sample coverage. 

`iNEXT3D` also plots the above two types of sampling curves and a sample completeness curve. The sample completeness curve provides a bridge between these two types of curves.

## MAIN FUNCTION: iNEXT3D()

We first describe the main function `iNEXT3D()` with default arguments: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
iNEXT3D(data, class = "TD", q = c(0,1,2), datatype = "abundance", 
        size = NULL, endpoint = NULL, knots = 40, conf = 0.95, 
        nboot = 50, tree = NULL, nT = NULL, reftime=NULL,
        PDtype = 'PD',distM = NULL, threshold = NULL)
```

The arguments of this function are briefly described below, and will be explained in more details by illustrative examples in later text. This main function computes diversity estimates of order q, the sample coverage estimates and related statistics for K (if `knots=K`) evenly‐spaced knots (sample sizes) between size 1 and the `endpoint`, where the endpoint is described below. Each knot represents a particular sample size for which diversity estimates will be calculated. By default, endpoint = double the reference sample size (total sample size for abundance data; total sampling units for incidence data). For example, if `endpoint = 10`, `knot = 4`, diversity estimates will be computed for a sequence of samples with sizes (1, 4, 7, 10).

## DATA FORMAT/INFORMATION
Three types of data are supported:

1. Individual‐based abundance data (`datatype="abundance"`): Input data for each assemblage/site include samples species abundances in an empirical sample of n individuals (“reference sample”). When there are N assemblages, input data consist of an S by N abundance matrix, or N lists of species abundances.  

2. Sampling‐unit‐based incidence data: There are two kinds of input data.  
 (1) Incidence‐raw data (`datatype="incidence_raw"`): for each assemblage, input data for a reference sample consist of a species‐by‐sampling‐unit matrix; when there are N assemblages, input data consist of N lists of matrices, and each matrix is a species‐by‐sampling‐unit matrix. If the phylogenetic diversity required, the matrix of combined assemblage is allowed, but nT must be specified (see above description)..  
  (2) Incidence‐frequency data (`datatype="incidence_freq"`): input data for each assemblage consist of species sample incidence frequencies (row sums of each incidence matrix). When there are N assemblages, input data consist of an S by N matrix, or N lists of species incidence frequencies. The first entry of each list must be the total number of sampling units, followed by the species incidence frequencies.
  
## RAREFACTION/EXTRAPOLATION VIA EXAMPLES

Two data sets (beetles for abundance data ) are included in iNEXT3D package. The first list of beetles' data consist of abundance data who live on three treatments (“Control”, “Debarked” and "Scratched") of trees. The second list consist of the pylogenetic tree for every beetles. And the third list consist of distance matrix for each pair of beetles. For these data, the following commands display the sample species abundances and run the `iNEXT3D()` function for three types of diversty  (`"TD"`, `"PD"`, `"FD"` with threshold dmean, `"AUC"` which integate FD from threshold 0-1) in `q = 0`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("beetles")
str(beetles.abu[[1]])
iNEXT3D(beetles.abu[[1]], class = c("TD", "PD", "FD", "AUC"), 
        q=0, datatype="abundance", tree = beetles.abu[[2]], 
        distM = beetles.abu[[3]])
```


If one diversity class required, then `iNEXT3D()` function returns including: `$Info` for summarizing data information; `$iNextEst` for showing diversity estimates along with related statistics for a series of rarefied and extrapolated samples; and `$AsyEst` for showing asymptotic diversity estimates along with related statistics, otherwise, returns lists which length equal to the number of diversity class required and also named by diversity class. Among each list include three data frames:`$Info`, `$iNextEst` and `$AsyEst`. 

`$Info`, as shown below, returns basic data information.  It can also be presented using function `DataInfo()` (for "TD"), `PDInfo()` (for "PD") and `FDInfo()` (for "FD").

Data description needed !!!. Diversity estimates and related statistics are computed for these 40 knots (corresponding to sample sizes m = 1, 598, 1195, …, 22692), which locates the reference sample at the mid‐point of the selected knots. If the argument se=TRUE, then the bootstrap method is applied to obtain the 95% confidence intervals for each diversity and sample coverage estimates. 

For the sample size corresponding to each knot, the first data frame of list `$iNextEst` (as shown below for 'size_based') under each diversity class includes the sample size (`m`, i.e., each of the 40 knots), the method (`interpolated`, `observed`, or `extrapolated`, depending on whether the size `m` is less than, equal to, or greater than the reference sample size), the diversity order, the diversity estimate of order q (`qD`, `qPD`, `qFD` and `AUC`), the 95% lower and upper confidence limits of diversity (`qD.LCL` with`qD.UCL`, `qPD.LCL` with `qPD.UCL`, `qFD.LCL` with `qFD.UCL` and `AUC.LCL` with `AUC.UCL`), and the sample coverage estimate (`SC`) along with the 95% lower and upper confidence limits of sample coverage (`SC.LCL`, `SC.UCL`). These sample coverage estimates with confidence intervals are used for plotting the sample completeness curve. Time consuming for `class = "AUC"`, therefore the demo shows only first three class.

The user may specify an integer sample size for the argument endpoint to designate the maximum sample size of R/E calculation. For species richness, the extrapolation method is reliable up to the double reference sample size; beyond that, the prediction bias may be large. However, for measures of q = 1 and 2, the extrapolation can usually be safely extended to the asymptotic if data are not sparse; thus there is no limit for the value of endpoint for these two measures. 

The user may also specify the number of knots in the range of sample size between 1 and the endpoint. If you choose a large number of knots, then it may take a long time to obtain the output due to the time‐consuming bootstrap method. Alternatively, the user may specify a series of sample sizes for R/E computation, as in the following example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# set a series of sample sizes (m) for R/E computation
m <- c(1, 5, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400)
iNEXT3D(beetles.abu[[1]], class = c("TD", "PD", "FD", "AUC"), 
       q = 0, datatype="abundance", size = m,
       tree = beetles.abu[[2]], 
       distM = beetles.abu[[3]])
```

Further, `iNEXT3D` can simultaneously run R/E computation for Hill numbers with q = 0, 1, and 2 by specifying a vector for the argument `q` as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
iNEXT3D(beetles.abu[[1]], class = c("TD", "PD", "FD", "AUC"),
        q = c(0,1,2), datatype="abundance", size = m,
        tree = beetles.abu[[2]], 
        distM = beetles.abu[[3]])
```

## GRAPHIC DISPLAYS: FUNCTION ggiNEXT3D()

The function `ggiNEXT3D()`, which extends `ggplot2` with default arguments, is described as follows: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggiNEXT3D(outcome, type = 1:3, se = TRUE,
          facet.var = "Assemblage", color.var = "Order.q")  
```
Here `outcome` is the object of `iNEXT3D()`'s output. Three types of curves are allowed for different diversity classes:  

(1) Sample-size-based R/E curve (`type=1`): see Figs. 1a and 2a in the main text. This curve plots diversity estimates with confidence intervals (if `se=TRUE`) as a function of sample size up to double the reference sample size, by default, or a user‐specified `endpoint`.  

(2) Sample completeness curve (`type=2`) with confidence intervals (if `se=TRUE`): see Figs. 1b and 2b in the main text. This curve plots the sample coverage with respect to sample size for the same range described in (1).  

(3) Coverage-based R/E curve (`type=3`): see Figs. 1c and 2c in the main text. This curve plots the diversity estimates with confidence intervals (if `se=TRUE`) as a 
function of sample coverage up to the maximum coverage obtained from the maximum size described in (1). 

The argument `facet.var=("Order.q", "Assemblage")` is used to create a separate plot for each value of the specified variable. For example, the following code displays a separate plot (in Figs 1a and 1c) for each value of the diversity order q. The `ggiNEXT3D()` function is a wrapper around 
`ggplot2` package to create a R/E curve using a single line of code. The resulting object is of class `"ggplot"`, so can be manipulated using the `ggplot2` tools. 


The argument `facet.var="Assemblage"` in `ggiNEXT3D` function creates a separate plot for each assembalge, therefore the different Order.q will seperated by different colours as shown below: 
```{r }
# Sample‐size‐based R/E curves, separating by "assemblage""
ggiNEXT3D(out, type=1, facet.var="Assemblage")


```

The argument `facet.var="Order.q"` in `ggiNEXT3D` function creates a separate plot for each order, therefore three assemblages will be seperated by different colours as shown below: 
```{r }
# Sample‐size‐based R/E curves, separating by "Order.q"
ggiNEXT3D(out, type=1, facet.var="Order.q")


```


The following commands return the sample completeness curve in which different colors are used for the three assemblages. Since the sample completeness curve are same for differnet class of diversity, `ggiNEXT3D` returns only one plot: 

```{r}
ggiNEXT3D(out, type=2, facet.var="Order.q", color.var="Assemblage")

```


The following commands return the coverage‐based R/E sampling curves in which different colors are used for the three assemblages (`facet.var="Assemblage"`) and for three orders 
(`facet.var="Order.q"`)

```{r}
AssType3 = ggiNEXT3D(out, type=3, facet.var="Assemblage")
AssType3
```



```{r}
OrderType3 = ggiNEXT3D(out, type=3, facet.var="Order.q")
OrderType3
```



## INCIDENCE DATA


For illustration, we use the Hinkley's fish data (in the dataset fish included in the package) at three time periods (2011-2013, 2014-2016 and 2017-2019). Data.frame of first list consist of incidence frequencies are shown below. The first row must be the total number of sampling units, followed by the species incidence frequencies.

```{r}
data("fish")
head(fish[[1]])

```

Note that incidence frequency data (`datatype = "incidence_freq`) is allowed only for diversity class: `"TD"`, `"FD"` and `"AUC"`.If `"PD"` required, use data form of incidence raw. The following commands return three time period R/E sampling curves for fish data. The argument `color.var =  "Assemblage"` is used to display curves in different colors for three time periods.

```{r}
data("fish")
fish.dis = fish[[3]]
t <- seq(1, 36, by=10)
out.inc <- iNEXT3D(data = fish[[1]], 
                   class = c("TD", "FD"),
                  q = c(0,1,2), datatype="incidence_freq", 
                  distM = fish.dis,
                  size = t)


# Sample‐size‐based R/E curves
ggiNEXT3D(out.inc, type=1, color.var="Assemblage")
```



```{r}
# Sample completeness curves
ggiNEXT3D(out.inc, type=2, color.var="Assemblage") 
```


```{r}
# Coverage‐based R/E curves
ggiNEXT3D(out.inc, type=3, color.var ="Assemblage")     
```


## RAW INCIDENCE DATA FUNCTION: incidence_raw

Incidence raw data is allowed for all diversity class. The data set (`fish.raw`) included in the package is three list of matrices; each matrix is a species by plots data.frame for a time period. 

```{r}
data("fish.raw")
names(fish.raw)
head(fish.raw[[1]])
head(fish.raw[[2]])
head(fish.raw[[3]])
```


```{r}
fish.tree = fish[[2]]
fish.dis = fish[[3]]

out.raw <- iNEXT3D(data = fish.raw, 
                   class = c("AUC"),
                  q = c(0), datatype="incidence_raw", 
                  tree = fish.tree,
                  distM = fish.dis,
                  size = t)
out.raw <- iNEXT3D(data = fish.raw, 
                   class = c("TD", "PD", "FD"),
                  q = c(0,1,2), datatype="incidence_raw", 
                  tree = fish.tree,
                  distM = fish.dis,
                  size = t)

out.raw.plot = ggiNEXT3D(out.raw, type = 1)
out.raw.plot
```
